Hi! I'm Xinyi, a graduate student researching material and sound culture. Welcome to my cyber space!

About
======
I am a graduate student at the Department of East Asian Languages & Civilizations, University of Pennsylvania. I received my BA with First Class Honors from The University of Hong Kong, where I double majored in art history and music and minored in French. 

My current research interest is material and sound culture in late Qing Dynasty and Republican China, with a focus on Sino-American interactions. Meanwhile, I have broad interests in global cultural heritage protection work, especially in archaeology and folk music.


Research Areas
======
I am interested in interdisciplinary and transregional research on a variety of humanities subjects. Here are some topics that interest me:

- East Asian textiles

- Historiography of Chinese art history & material culture

- Folk music/ethnomusicology of East Asia and the Americas

- Global Jazz

- Cultural heritage site protection and tourism

- Digital humanities

I am also interested in exploring unconventional/multimedia publication forms for academic research.

Feel free to contact me for any reason, such as research collaboration, learning about college/graduate school experience, or simply finding someone to chitchat. 

I believe free open access to information helps create equality in the world, and thatâ€™s why I love to share my stories. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me so we can bridge the gap!
